        <h3>Who was Richard Feynman?</h3>
        <p>Richard Phillips Feynman (May 11, 1918 – February 15, 1988) was an American theoretical physicist, one of the pioneers of quantum electrodynamics, known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics and the theory of quantum electrodynamics.</p>
        <p>He was born in New York and grew up in Far Rockaway. As a child he had demonstrated ease with science and mathematics. When Feynman was 15, he taught himself trigonometry, advanced algebra, infinite series, analytic geometry, and both differential and integral calculus. Before entering college, he was experimenting with and deriving mathematical topics such as the half-derivative using his own notation. He applied to Columbia University but was not accepted because of their quota for the number of Jews admitted. Instead, he attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
        <p>Later in life he became a professor at Cornell University and then the California Institute of Technology, where he served as a professor for 35 years. His lectures for undegraduates at Caltech gave rise to one of his most respected works, the Feynman Lectures on Physics, originally published in 1963. Two years later, in 1965, Feynman received the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on quantum electrodynamics. In addition, he worked in the Project Manhattan, conceived the idea of quantum computing and participated in the commission investigating the Challenger Space Shuttle accident.</p>
        <p> In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World he was ranked as one of the ten greatest physicists of all time.</p>

        <h3>Richard Feynman in Brazil</h3>
        <p>In the early 1950s, Feynman became interested in South America and taught as a guest of Jayme Tiomno at the Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisa Física (<em>Brazilian Center for Research in Physics</em>) in Rio de Janeiro. Between 1951 and 1952, Feynman spent several months in Brazil and his stay is reported in the chapter "The American, Again!" from your book "You're joking, Mr. Feynman!" Among other subjects describes his amusing experience with the Brazilian people, with the Portuguese language and with the music (percussion and samba). At the end of the chapter he used the experience he had with his students and their failures during learning to critique the method of learning through rote memorization rather than using reasoning.
